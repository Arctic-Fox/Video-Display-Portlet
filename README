Video Display Portlet
by Chris Jurado, Johns Hopkins University Institute for Computational Medicine
Designed for Liferay Version 6

This portlet will play .swf videos stored in the Liferay Document Library.  The files and enclosing folders must have view permissions for the intended users.

Use Portlet Preferences to set the server name and the location of the desired folder in the Document Library.

To install:

First, build this project:

-Copy the folder into your local liferay SDK environment in the portlets folder.
-Run the enclosed ant build script (ant deploy)
-If your local environment is configured to automatically copy the resulting .war file into your Liferay Deploy folder, it will install automatically for you from there.  Otherwise you can manually copy the .war file into your Liferay deploy folder
-OR-
Upload the file through the Liferay GUI plugins installation screen.

By default, Liferay is not configured to accept .swf files.  Yuo can edit your portal-ext.properties file to include them.  It's also a good idea to increase the size of your maximum file allowed in the Document Library if you intend to show large files:

dl.file.extensions=.bmp,.css,.doc,.dot,.gif,.gz,.htm,.html,.jpg,.js,.lar,.odb,.odf,.odg,.odp,.ods,.odt,.pdf,.png,.ppt,.rtf,.swf,.sxc,.sxi,.sxw,.tar,.tiff,.tgz,.txt,.vsd,.xls,.xml,.zip,.avi,.mov,.wmv,.flv
dl.file.max.size=60072000

These settings are also available in the Control Panel under Server Administration -->  File Uploads.
